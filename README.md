## Poem classification with BERT, AlBERT, and RoBERTa


Designed and implemented a poem classification system using BERT-based transformers and natural language processing techniques. Leveraging the power of PyTorch, I meticulously trained and rigorously evaluated a variety of BERT-based models on a rich corpus comprising 990 poems, culminating in an impressive 62% accuracy score for the highest-performing model.
